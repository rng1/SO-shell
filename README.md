# Unix shell in C
This shell is part of the semestral asignment for the Operating Systems 2021/2022 course at the UDC (Universidade da Coru√±a). All of the code was written in C, and since many of the program's functions use system specific libraries, it certainly won't work in Windows or Mac systems.

## Warning
Part of it may be broken, part of it may be less optimized than I would like, and you may encounter some errors or bugs I didn't notice while making this thing. But it's a uni project with strict deadlines, so some corners had to be cut to ensure it would be delivered on time.
